# Pima-diabetes-dataset-
This dataset is from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The aim of this project is to diagnose if a particular patient has diabetes based on various medical factors in the dataset. All patients are females and are atleast 21 years old. 
This dataset contains of one targer variable i.e the outcome and several predictor variables such as BMI, weight, No. of pregancies etc. 


We would like to build a model that would  accurately predict if the patient has diabetes or not. 

The Pima diabetes dataset consists of 9 variables:  

#Pregnancies -Number of times pregnant
#GlucosePlasma -glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
#BloodPressure- Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
#SkinThicknessTriceps -skin fold thickness (mm)
#Insulin2- Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
#BMIBody mass index- (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
#DiabetesPedigreeFunctionDiabetes -pedigree function
#Age -(years)
#OutcomeClass variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
